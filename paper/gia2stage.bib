  abstract = {Recent observations indicate that many marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica are currently retreating and thinning, potentially due to long-term trends in climate forcing. In this study, we describe a simple two-stage model that accurately emulates the response to external forcing of marine-terminating glaciers simulated in a spatially extended model. The simplicity of the model permits derivation of analytical expressions describing the marine-terminating glacier response to forcing. We find that there are two time scales that characterize the stable glacier response to external forcing, a fast time scale of decades to centuries, and a slow time scale of millennia. These two time scales become unstable at different thresholds of bed slope, indicating that there are distinct slow and fast forms of the marine ice sheet instability. We derive simple expressions for the approximate magnitude and transient evolution of the stable glacier response to external forcing, which depend on the equilibrium glacier state and the strength of nonlinearity in forcing processes. The slow response rate of marine-terminating glaciers indicates that current changes at some glaciers are set to continue and accelerate in coming centuries in response to past climate forcing and that the current extent of change at these glaciers is likely a small fraction of the future committed change caused by past climate forcing. Finally, we find that changing the amplitude of natural fluctuations in some nonlinear forcing processes, such as ice shelf calving, changes the equilibrium glacier state.},

Whatever understanding we had of this phenomenon came principally from theoretical work (Weertman, 1957, 1958, 1962; L. Lliboutry, 1959, 1963). The situation now is changing. B. Kamb and E. LaChapelle (1963, 1964) have carried out extremely interesting field studies and laboratory tests on the mechanisms involved in glacier sliding. Lliboutry and R. Brepson (1963) have constructed a large machine in which 30 kg blocks of ice will be made to slide. G. R. Elliston (1963) has shown from field work on the Gornergletscher that (melt) water at the bottom of a glacier profoundly influences the sliding velocity.",

  abstract = {The stress intensity factor K at the upper tip of a vertical, liquid-filled crack in the earth's crust is large for relatively small cracks (K>3 MPa m½ when the crack length is larger than about 40 m). Consequently, the large water-filled cracks considered for use in the extraction of geothermal heat might be expected to pop to the earth' surface. In this paper it is shown that a freely slipping horizontal joint (as well as a not so freely slipping joint) can stop the upward motion of a large liquid-filled crack. If the joint is tightly fitting, there is no limit to the length of a stopped crack. If slip on a joint results in the joint being propped open, the maximum crack length of a stopped crack is given by the crevasse expression: total crack length = πT/2(ρ −ρ ′)g, where T is the tectonic stress, g is the gravitational acceleration, and ρ −ρ′ is the difference between the rock and liquid density. The results can also be applied to the problem of magma transport in the earth's crust. In particular, laccolith emplacement is favored when the nonhydrostatic tectonic stress component is compressive in character.},

The model predicts ice thickness and bedrock deformation in a north-south cross section, with a prescribed snow-budget distribution shifted vertically to represent the orbital pertur-bations. An ice calving parameterization is added, crudely representing proglacial lakes or marine incursions that attack the ice whenever the tip drops below sea level. With this extension the model produces a large 100 kyr response with complete de-glaciations, and agrees fairly well with the $\delta$18 0 deep-sea core records.},

  abstract = {The ice sheet–ice shelf transition zone plays an important role in controlling marine ice sheet dynamics, as it determines the rate at which ice flows out of the grounded part of the ice sheet. Together with accumulation, this outflow is the main control on the mass balance of the grounded sheet. In this paper, we verify the results of a boundary layer theory for ice flux in the transition zone against numerical solutions that are able to resolve the transition zone. Very close agreement is obtained, and grid refinement in the transition zone is identified as a critical component in obtaining reliable numerical results. The boundary layer theory confirms that ice flux through the grounding line in a two-dimensional sheet-shelf system increases sharply with ice thickness at the grounding line. This result is then applied to the large-scale dynamics of a marine ice sheet. Our principal results are that (1) marine ice sheets do not exhibit neutral equilibrium but have well-defined, discrete equilibrium profiles; (2) steady grounding lines cannot be stable on reverse bed slopes; and (3) marine ice sheets with overdeepened beds can undergo hysteresis under variations in sea level, accumulation rate, basal slipperiness, and ice viscosity. This hysteretic behavior can in principle explain the retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet following the Last Glacial Maximum and may play a role in the dynamics of Heinrich events.},
